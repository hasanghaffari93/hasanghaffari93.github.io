##### Project Description:

Clinical Intake System is an conversational AI system designed to streamline healthcare patient intake processes through intelligent automation. The platform features two specialized AI agents: a Creator Agent that conducts structured clinical interviews to systematically collect patient health profiles across 15+ medical categories (demographics, symptoms, allergies, medications, medical history, etc.), and an Explorer Agent that enables healthcare providers to query and retrieve patient information through natural language conversations.
