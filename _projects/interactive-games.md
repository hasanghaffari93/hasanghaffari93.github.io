# **Augmented Rock Climbing**

- Implemented real-time pose estimation model to identify the locations of children's hands and feet.
- Utilized a real-time multi-object tracker (MOT) to track children across camera frames.
- Optimized pose estimation model to reduce model size and inference time to be deployed on general-purpose computer systems.
- Integrated AI into Unity


##### **Description**

The Augmented Rock Climbing Wall Game is an interactive game, implemented in Robokids, that combines traditional rock climbing with augmented reality (AR) technology. Let's see how it works:

1. **Projection**: The climbing wall is equipped with a projector that display various interactive elements such as targets, obstacles, and game graphics directly onto the wall surface.
2. **Real-time Motion Tracking**: A webcam track the climberâ€™s movements in real-time. This allows the system to respond dynamically to the climber's actions.
3. **Game Mechanics**: Climbers can participate in different types of games, such as hitting targets, following specific routes, or avoiding obstacles.

# **Interactive Painting**

- designed and implemented a real-time detection and segmentation of fictional characters painted by children using image processing and augmented reality (AR) techniques


##### **Features**
- Webcam Support
- Real-time Painting Detection and Segmentation
- Windows and Linux Support
- Fisheye Correction
- Not sensitive to distance and angle between camera and paper
- Integrated with Unity


##### **Product Description**
1. Child color various drawings and place their painitng into a designated box.
2. The system uses advanced image processing to recognize and extract different elements from the painitng.
3. Once the painitng is processed, it is animated and displayed on a large screen.

For example, if a child colors a sun, the sun is brought to life on the screen, creating an effect where it appears to move and transition into daylight.
