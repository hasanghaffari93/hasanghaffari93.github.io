##### **Product Description**

Utilizing advanced AI and machine vision technology, this fully automated machine is designed to classify pistachios into different classes. The Sorting Machine integrates mechanical, electronic, software, AI, and industrial design to deliver precise sorting with high capacity. Here's how it works:



1. Pistachios are loaded into a large hopper.
2. A conveyor belt transports the pistachios into the machine.
3. Using a complex mechanical mechanism, the pistachios are arranged in a single file.
4. The pistachios are then released at high speed in free fall, passing through a dark box.
5. During this brief moment, four cameras capture images of each pistachio from different views.
6. The images are processed by an AI model that classifies the pistachios.
7. Based on the classification, high-pressure air directs the pistachios into their designated boxes.
