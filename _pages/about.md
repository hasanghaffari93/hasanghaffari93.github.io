I am an AI and machine learning engineer with over 6 years of experience, primarily working in fast-paced startup environments to integrate AI into innovative products. Currently, I am focusing on large language models (LLMs), AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chatbot development.

A significant part of my expertise lies in machine learning and computer vision, where I have developed, deployed, and optimized deep learning models for various applications, including image classification, object detection, person re-identification, multi-object tracking, and face recognition.
 
I have also built data pipelines for data collection, annotation, augmentation, and preprocessing to either fine-tune models or train them from scratch. Additionally, I’ve optimized models for real-time performance across various mobile platforms and edge devices.

I always enjoy new challenges, and would like to learn in this rapidly evolving field!
